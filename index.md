<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Electrochemical Engine Center](https://ecec.me.psu.edu/) (ECEC) and [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.psu.edu/) at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Chao-Yang Wang](https://www.me.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=CXW31). Previously, I completed my M.S. at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and my B.S. at [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.bjtu.edu.cn/). My current research interests mainly lie in **battery safety**.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly running, cycling and working out at the gym), traveling, and going on hikes with friends (find my workout records on my [Strava page](https://www.strava.com/athletes/shaoyanliu)<style>
